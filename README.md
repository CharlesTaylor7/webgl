Simulation of an exotic twisty puzzle. The shape is a truncated octahedron with center cuts. It allows turning on 4 different axes at 120 degree angles. 
The shape has a total of 14 sides, 8 hexagonal, and 6 square. 

It is a simpler version of the [Dayan gem IV](https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2811) which includes 3 cuts per axis, which allows the hexgaonal faces to turn.
